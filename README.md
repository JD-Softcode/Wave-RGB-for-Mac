# WaveRGB_Mac

## Version 1.2.1
This is the mac version of my Wave RGB app. It simply creates waves of light that ripple away from each key as you type. The size and color of each ring is user configurable. In the Windows app, those settings are controlled by LGS' Applet Configuration interface, however the API was not working in the Mac version of their developmental macOS SDK so a separate interface is implemented.

Download the executable from www.jdsoftcode.net

This archive does not include the LGS dynamic library (framework). It's available on request from Logitech developer support.
